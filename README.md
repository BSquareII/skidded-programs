# skidded-programs
a pack of garbage and stolen source code programs made from dumb low-class skids (including myself lol) from around the internet 

some of them are harmless and easy to remove with simple registry fixes. And the others are very dangerous like destroying the MBR (Master Boot Record), makes your mouse unusable, deletes system files and registry keys that are VERY IMPORTANT to windows.

please ALWAYS use a safety environment or a virtual machine and use them at your very own risk.
